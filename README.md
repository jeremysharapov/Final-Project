# Final-Project/NormalRPG
Welcome to NormalRPG. This is your average role-playing, text-based, terminal-oriented game.
Requirements: Just javac NormalRPG.java and then java NormalRPG

To play, simply: 
  1. Type the choicein [] brackets when prompted (it is not case sensitive, but be sure to spell it right!)
  2. Press enter to input your decision.

Ta da! Simple as 1, 2, 3~

Some helpful tips to help you in your travels:
  1. The wizard class is the only class to start with one skill already discovered!
  2. Go to the healing hospital to have free HP and MP recovery!
  3. The Mayor will give you Story Quests! And if you ever forget what your Quest is, simply ask him again and he'll tell you!
  4. And remember, always be on the eye for the shiny prize ;)
Have fun~

Some things we haven't implemented/fixed:
  Side Quests
  Visuals (Map, pixelated yous, etc)
  Inventory
  Gear and Weapons
  Text Log/History
  More skills and skill related traits
  More mobs, more areas, more quests~
  Colored/Customized text
  Balance!!!!
  The Traveler's Guide q-q
  A missing while loop during the skills tab (if you accidentally hit enter without the write command typed the mob will still attack!)
  A glitch in the leveling system (it only sometimes works??)
  A credits screen (-gaspu-) so for now take this:
      This was NormalRPG.java
      Made by Jeremy Sharapov and Emily Wang
      Hope you had fun!!
